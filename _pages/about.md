<h2>Teaching & Research Interests</h2>
My teaching and research interests cover the fields of  data science, predictive analytics, and machine learning, focusing on the application of these disciplines in a variety of domains, including information technology implementation, network and computer security, health informatics, marketing,  and learning analytics.<br>
I am the recipient of the <a href="http://eitellauria.ar?page_id=1869">2015 Board of Trustees Distinguished Teaching Award</a>.

<h2>Short Biographical Statement</h2>
I worked in the IT industry for 20+ years, advising on such topics as decision support systems, business analytics, distributed application development and e-business. As a managing partner with <a href="https://www.gldconsultores.com/">GLD Consultores</a>, I worked with a number of organizations across a wide range of industries, including Microsoft, IBM, Exxon, Reuters, Philip Morris, Hewlett Packard, STET France Telecom, Accenture and Ryder.<br>
I hold a degree in Electrical Engineering from University of Buenos Aires, Argentina, an MBA from Universidad del Salvador (Argentina) / University of Deusto (Spain), and a PhD in Information Science from University at Albany, State University of New York. Before coming to Marist, I was a Lecturer at the Dept. of Management Science and Information Systems, School of Business, University at Albany. In Argentina I was a Faculty member and Chair of the MIS Dept. at the School of Business, Universidad del Salvador.<br>
I live in Delmar, 7 miles south of Albany, NY with my wife Corinne. We have two incredible daughters, Florencia and Maia, and a beautiful grandson, Tomás, born in 2020. I'm a scuba diver, an avid squash player,  a former rugby player, and I have a passion for  <a href="https://lanacionar-prod.video.arc-cdn.net/wp-lanacionar/20230118/63c80461c471e46a750460f7/t_0ee88fb793f44b899f70904b910c67ae_name_LN___ETERNOS_subtitulado_FINAL/file_1280x720-2000-v3_1.mp4">soccer</a>. I am also a really bad skier. And I paint a bit.

<h2>My Heritage</h2>
I was born and raised in Buenos Aires, Argentina, so I  describe myself as an “Argentino” and a “Porteño” -nick name given to those who grew up in the city of Buenos Aires and its surrounding neighborhoods (it originally referred to those immigrants that came through the port of Buenos Aires in the early 20th century). The Argentine genetic mixture is mostly made up of Spanish, Italian and Native American ancestry components, spiced up with flavors of Jewish, British, German, Syrian-Lebanese, African, Armenian, and Eastern European. This ethnical cocktail is what probably makes <a href="https://therealargentina.com/en/argentinian-or-argentinean-decisions-decisions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Argentineans</a> loud, outgoing, big huggers and kissers, and with little sense of personal space. Argentineans speak with their hands and are great friends of their friends. As divisive and whining as they can be -they quarrel about everything, including politics and soccer, the country’s true religion- they settle matters around food, having lunch or dinner together, that can take forever.
