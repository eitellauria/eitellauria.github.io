    MSIS645/DATA450 -Data Mining & Predictive Analytics <br>
    Data Mining & Predictive Analytics is the name given to a group of disciplines, technologies, applications and practices for analyzing data (usually based on past business performance) and building models to help enterprise users make better, faster business decisions. This course introduces basic concepts, tasks, methods, and techniques in data mining, including data exploration and pre-processing, classification, regression, clustering, association, performance evaluation applied to predictive modeling.

   CMPT428 -Data & Information Management <br>
   This course aims to introduce the technologies and disciplines responsible for the effective management of structured and unstructured data and information in organizations. Topics covered include data sourcing, extraction transformation and loading processes, data warehousing architectures, dimensional modeling, online analytical processing, businessperformance management, dashboards and visualization, and massive (Big) data processing. We will start by tackling structured data in a relational and multidimensional environment. In the second part of the semester we will tackle Big Data processing: distributed computing, the Hadoop ecosystem and Apache Spark.

  DATA440 -Machine Learning <br>
  This course provides a broad introduction to automated learning from data. Machine learning is the name given to the collection of techniques that allow computational systems to adaptively improve their performance by learning from past observed data. The course introduces the theoretical underpinnings of learning from data, the study of learning algorithms, as well as machine learning applications. Topics include: supervised and unsupervised learning  (including linear models, support vector machines, decision trees,  PCA, neural networks) , regularization methods, validation and model selection.
  An introduction to deep learning will be included. The Python language and several Python libraries (Numpy, Matplotlib, Pandas, scikit-learn, Tensorflow 2.0/Keras) will be used to illustrate various machine learning techniques.

CMPT489/MSCS589 - Special Topic: Natural Language Processing & Text Mining  <br>
Text mining and natural language processing are critical tools for understanding and processing the huge volumes of unstructured textual data that is constantly being generated in today's world. The goal of this course is to help students learn to develop software systems capable of analyzing, understanding and generating written text. The course covers some of the most relevant tasks in this domain, including tokenization and lemmatization, text classification, embeddings, language modeling, and language generation using machine learning and deep learning (neural) methods. The students will acquire a basic understanding of text mining and machine learning techniques applied to text, including supervised and unsupervised methods, deep learning techniques (implemented in Keras), feed forward neural networks, CNNs, RNNs and LSTM networks.
